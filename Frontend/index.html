            <li>Stress can contribute to high blood pressure, heart disease, and increased risk of heart attacks </li>
            <li> Prolonged stress weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections, illnesses, and slower recovery times.</li>
            <li>    Chronic stress is closely linked to anxiety disorders and depression. It can lead to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, irritability, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions.</li>
            <li>  Stress often disrupts sleep patterns, leading to insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or experiencing restful sleep.</li>
            <li> Chronic stress may cause individuals to withdraw from social activities, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation. Lack of social support can further exacerbate stress and mental health issues.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The curated nature of social media content often leads to comparisons with others, which can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and depression, especially among vulnerable populations like adolescents.</li>
            <li> constant exposure to others' seemingly perfect lives and experiences can instill a fear of missing out, leading to anxiety and a sense of inadequacy in one's own life.</li>
            <li> Excessive use of social media can interfere with daily activities, sleep patterns, and face-to-face interactions, contributing to feelings of isolation and decreased productivity.</li>
