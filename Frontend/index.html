       <div class="para1"><p>Stress can contribute to high blood pressure, heart disease, and increased risk of heart attacks  
        Prolonged stress weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections, illnesses, and slower recovery times.
        Chronic stress is closely linked to anxiety disorders and depression. It can lead to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, irritability, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions.
        Stress often disrupts sleep patterns, leading to insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or experiencing restful sleep.
        Chronic stress may cause individuals to withdraw from social activities, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation. Lack of social support can further exacerbate stress and mental health issues.

       <div class="subhead1"><h2>Impact of Social Media on Mental Health </h2></div>

       <div class="para1"><p>The curated nature of social media content often leads to comparisons with others, which can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and depression, especially among vulnerable populations like adolescents.
        constant exposure to others' seemingly perfect lives and experiences can instill a fear of missing out, leading to anxiety and a sense of inadequacy in one's own life.
        Excessive use of social media can interfere with daily activities, sleep patterns, and face-to-face interactions, contributing to feelings of isolation and decreased productivity.
